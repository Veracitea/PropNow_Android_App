# PropNow_Android_App
Housing information app using Android Studio.
### This was a software engineering project done for the software engineering module in NTU.

## Some libraries may be outdated but the following have to be done to run the code:
Extract code and run on an Android device. Do not run at Android studio(prone to crash). External API tensorflow(camera.zip) has to be extracted and placed in mobile as well. Note that path changes have to be changed to the same as the sdk in your directory.

### Other information:
Read SRS.pdf for report, note that not all sequence diagrams were shown, only relevant ones were pointed out
